#An array is an ordered list of objects
#We use the word "elements" to describe items in array. 
#array itself is an object 
#example:a box can hold multiple things in it. The box is an object...
#and everything in it is a object

numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
p numbers 

#spacing and comma is important bc that is what is distinguishing the items
